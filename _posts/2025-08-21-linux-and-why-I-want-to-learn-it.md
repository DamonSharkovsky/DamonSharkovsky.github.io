I’m relatively new to Linux, having primarily used Windows, so stepping into a new environment was initially challenging. While I had heard of Ubuntu, I hadn’t explored it deeply. I want to understand Linux because it’s a foundational part of computing, cybersecurity, and software development. Its efficiency, minimal bloat, and speed make it a powerful platform.

I’ve started learning Linux as part of my studies, familiarizing myself with the command line and basic operations. I know a few commands, but I’m still building deeper expertise.

## Goals of Learning Linux

- Explore system internals and understand how operating systems work.  
- Practice scripting and automation to solve real problems. For example, I’ve used AI to create scripts like automating Firefox sessions, but I aim to master scripting thoroughly and understand it from the ground up.  
- Build a foundation in cybersecurity by experimenting safely in Linux environments, eventually exploring Kali Linux.  

Learning Linux is about more than just commands; it’s about developing a mindset for experimentation, troubleshooting, and independent problem-solving. The terminal can be intimidating, but embracing challenges is part of the growth process.

## Long-Term Goal

I currently use **Linux Mint** for its user-friendliness and smooth transition from Windows, and I also use **Pop!_OS** at my learning place. Both are Ubuntu-based, so they feel similar, but they help me get accustomed to Linux environments. My ultimate goal is to move to **Arch Linux**, a minimalist distribution that requires deep understanding and hands-on practice. This transition will test and solidify my skills.

This post marks the beginning of documenting my Linux journey: the challenges I face, the experiments I run, and the lessons I learn along the way.
